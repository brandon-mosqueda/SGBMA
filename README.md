# Secure and efficient decentralized machine learning through group-based model aggregation

This repository contains the source code for the experiments conducted in the paper *"Secure and efficient decentralized machine learning through group-based model aggregation"*.

Files `run_decentralized.R`, `run_federated_learninig.R` and `run_sgbma.R` are the main entry points to reproduce the experiments. They import the rest of the files where multiple functions and classes are defined. At the beggining of `"run_"` files there are defined all the required parameters of the experiments.
